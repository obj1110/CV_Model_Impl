# Introduction

It is hard to make people believe you have the ability for ML and DL without code, this responsitory is set up to proof my ability. I run these models on my own PC with a 3060 Laptop GPU.

# Installation and Dependencies

This project runs on Python 3.6.13 and Pytorch 1.2.0 and torchvision 0.4.0.

You can create a anaconda virtual environment to run.(virtual env does not work well in my PC)

Also, GPUs are needed to accelerate. The version is cuda 10.0 and cudnn 7.8.5.

# large file excluded in Github

I have a great trouble submitting when the CV_Model_Impl folder contains large file (*.pth,*.tgz)ï¼Œ after struggling with Google and OpenAI, I give up the attempt. I have placed such files outside CV_Model_Impl. Later I will try to solve such problem, mainly problems concerned with GIT.
