# Introduction

It is hard to make people believe you have the ability for ML and DL without code, this responsitory is set up to proof my ability. I run these models on my own PC with a 3060 Laptop GPU.

# Installation and Dependencies

This project runs on Python 3.6.13 and Pytorch 1.2.0 and torchvision 0.4.0.

You can create a anaconda virtual environment to run.(virtual env does not work well in my PC)

Also, GPUs are needed to accelerate. The version is cuda 10.0 and cudnn 7.8.5.
